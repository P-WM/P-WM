## Engineering Experience

#### May 2020-November 2021
### Lead Data Engineer @ TrueLayer


`Python | AWS | Athena/Presto | Hive | EMR | Spark | Airflow | k8s`

As the first Data Engineering hire, I've worked to build out the analytics team and help TrueLayer to understand its customers better, enable data-driven decisions and build a Data Ops culture.

- **Line management** of 2 Data Engineers (+substantial work hiring for a multi-discplinary team including analysts)
- **Reduced compute cost** (and processing time) for business-critical logs ETL by **>80%**
- **Increased trust** in our internal data by introducing **meaningful SLAs**:
  - Added automatic **reporting of latency and quality concerns** with accessible dashboards
  - Shifted team metrics from pipeline success to **data freshness/consistency**
  - Added **alerting for key datasets and pipelines** to enable proactive response to SLA failure
  - Increased **observability** for all data processing by adding off the shelf task orchestration (Airflow) and reporting of key metrics (e.g. CPU/memory used)
- Led **organisation-wide efforts** to standardise and improve product analytics
- **Enabled more ad-hoc queries for non-expert users** and substantially **fresher reporting (e.g. daily/hourly rather than monthly)** by creating small, comprehensible datasets for the most common questions. Previously much of our analytics (and billing) had relied on scraping our logs which is expensive on a bytes-scanned system (>200GB created per day) and only accessible to a small number of well-versed engineers
- Automated billing based on these datasets, removing dependence on multiple spreadsheets and manual intervention from multiple engineering teams and finance. **Reduced time to invoice customers from >2 weeks after month end to <3 days**
- Brought engineering best practices to existing jobs and pipelines, such as adding automated testing, version control and observability
- **Provided advice and simple solutions for ML engineers** dealing with too great a load of data at rest and in transit

#### July 2019-May 2020
### Data Engineer @ Elliptic


`Scala | Terraform | AWS | Redshift + Spectrum | Spark | Airflow | NiFi | Python | BASH`

I joined the platform team, responsible for providing analyses of cryptocurrency addresses and transactions to answer anti money laundering (AML) queries.

- **Built and maintained ETL pipelines** to combine public data from several blockchains with our own proprietary intelligence in one graph; maintained an API to provide sector-leading analyses based on this graph.
- **Researched new cryptocurrencies and blockchains** to understand how best **to extract data from them and model them in our warehouse**.
- Created a template to add cryptocurrencies to our platform allowing us to **rapidly create the infrastructure and processes** required, **book ~$750k in revenue** and be **first to market** with an AML solution for XRP .
- Worked in a small team to implement these currencies and **deliver lucrative contracts on time every time**.
- Provided substantial **QoL improvements for developers** including **automating sharing of secrets** (previously plain text files had been exchanged in some cases) and running test jobs/deployments etc.
- Added **CI pipelines** with **automated build and testing** as well as **one-click deploys with easy rollback** across different environments for several services

#### Jan 2019-July 2019
### Data Engineer @ nested.com


`Python | GCP | BigQuery | k8s | Terraform | Dataflow/Apache Beam | Rundeck | Airflow | Looker`

Joined a brand new multi-discplinary team focused mainly on BI, empowering our analysts and data scientists.

- **Gave BI analysts greater autonomy** by automagically populating a BigQuery dataset from their queries, enabling them to prototype and productionise their own exports without engineering input:
  - Freed up engineering resource and **reduced analysts' cycle time from ~1.5 weeks to 1 day**;
  - Added **contract testing** to eliminate a pernicious class of bugs that could bring down all our reporting due to a typo in one field name.
- Promoted **engineering best practices** across disciplines:
  - Added **CI pipeline** to our main data processing repo giving us better **automated testing**, formatting, linting and validation of migrations;
  - Worked with analysts to build a workflow appropriate for their needs including peer review, automated generation and deployment of documentation, and automated validation of their models.
- Helped to **lead and deliver** a project to **move our whole data infrastructure (mostly from k8s) to PaaS**:
  - I focused on identifying the biggest risks; adding them to the risk register where relevant; negotiating an informal SLA to allow us to prioritise them; and working with senior management to **allocate the necessary engineering resource** to mitigate them.

#### Nov 2017-Jan 2019
### Full-Stack Software Engineer @ nested.com


`Elixir | GraphQL | JavaScript | CSS/HTML | React | Postgres | SQL | Docker | GCP`

- **End-to-end implementation of data-science model** for **qualification recommendation engine**:
  - Took rough **Jupyter notebook** to production with tests, documentation, monitoring, migrations etc.
  - Identified and corrected errors in **calculating distance from lat/long** and time on market for listings data
  - Stored and presented results in in-house CRM and pushed to third-party service for ease of use
- **Implemented redesign of front-end of our in-house CRM** to designer's specifications
- Undertook **on-call duty** to ensure business-critical service uptime >99%

## Diversity

I have a real **passion for diversity**. I want to make the world of tech look a bit less like me and enjoy giving my time to support this:

- _Code First: Girls_ -- Coached a number of eight-week programmes in person and online to introduce women and non-binary people to coding, data and the web. Multiple participants have now started work as developers, and I'm over the moon!
- _codebar (Enable underrepresented people to learn programming in a collaborative environment)_ -- **Regular coach**
- _Career Accelerator (Raise opportunity and aspirations for 13-17 year olds interested and underrepresented in tech)_ -- **Ran workshops** for and **mentored participants**
- _Founders and Coders (London-based bootcamp, free for students)_ -- Worked with a team of colleagues to **deliver quarterly two-day workshops** introducing `Elixir` and `GraphQL`. Met lots of new people from outside our traditional recruitment funnel and (at last) hired a woman
- _RailsGirls London_ -- Presented [Nested as a sponsor](https://twitter.com/eloisanoble/status/1068821716124737537) and [**volunteered as a coach**](https://twitter.com/AfuaDanquah1/status/1193578469994704897)
- [_Living & Working With Depression_](https://medium.com/what-i-did-on-my-working-holiday/living-and-working-with-depression-eee1f9e18a8d) -- A popular blog I wrote about depression in the workplace. A lot of people contacted me saying that it had given them really useful tips for supporting direct reports or helped them to open up a dialogue with their own manager. Some people said it made them cry -- you've been warned!
