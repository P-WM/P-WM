# Hi there 👋 It's me, Peter

👈 I'm that one over there with the stool-eating grin.

## Would you like a job? 👩‍💻

Ooooh, _maybe_... I've spent the last year or so doing short projects with early stage tech teams getting from 0.5 to 1 (the really sticky bit 😬). Gnarly questions I like dealing with are:
- We've got a cool MVP but how do we make it, like, ready for _actual_, _human_ customer people?
- This ragtag bunch of blokes were super productive but now we have moneyz; how do make a proper team of people that consistently delivers?
- Did those shoes come as a pair or did you mix them yourself?

I'm currently helping out at [SELECT.dev](https://select.dev) where they're scaling their super-cool Snowflake cost-optimization product—check it out if you're paying Snowflake loads!

Feel free to check my [out of date CV](CV.md) and reach me at [jobs@p-wm.dev](mailto:jobs@p-wm.dev).

## What's your bag? 🛍️

- Observability & Testing
- Teamwork
- Diversity

### Diversity

I have a real **passion for diversity**. I want to make the world of tech look a bit less like me and enjoy giving my time to support this:

- _Code First: Girls_ — Coached a number of eight-week programmes and the 12-week intensive nanodegree to introduce women and non-binary people to coding, data and the web. Multiple participants have now started work as developers, and I'm over the moon!
- _codebar (Enable underrepresented people to learn programming in a collaborative environment)_ ,_Career Accelerator (Raise opportunity and aspirations for 13-17 year olds interested and underrepresented in tech)_: Occasional coach and mentor
- _RailsGirls London_: Presented [Nested as a sponsor](https://twitter.com/eloisanoble/status/1068821716124737537) and [**volunteered as a coach**](https://twitter.com/AfuaDanquah1/status/1193578469994704897)
- [_Living & Working With Depression_](https://p-wm.dev/mental-health): A popular blog I wrote about depression in the workplace. A lot of people contacted me saying that it had given them really useful tips for supporting direct reports or helped them to open up a dialogue with their own manager. Some people said it made them cry -- you've been warned!

## You got any awards? 💅

Only one that's relevant to GitHub (but let me know if you're interested in examples of excellent community co-production). I told you I'm into diversity!

## What about pets? 🐭

I have two gerbils, _The White One_ (brown coat) and _The Brown One_ (albino). They like nibbling toilet rolls, digging and choosing a different place to pee each week.
