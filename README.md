### Diversity

I have a real **passion for diversity**. I want to make the world of tech look a bit less like me and enjoy giving my time to support this:

- _Code First: Girls_ — Coached a number of eight-week programmes and the 12-week intensive nanodegree to introduce women and non-binary people to coding, data and the web. Multiple participants have now started work as developers, and I'm over the moon!
- _codebar (Enable underrepresented people to learn programming in a collaborative environment)_ ,_Career Accelerator (Raise opportunity and aspirations for 13-17 year olds interested and underrepresented in tech)_: Occasional coach and mentor
- _RailsGirls London_: Presented [Nested as a sponsor](https://twitter.com/eloisanoble/status/1068821716124737537) and [**volunteered as a coach**](https://twitter.com/AfuaDanquah1/status/1193578469994704897)
- [_Living & Working With Depression_](https://medium.com/what-i-did-on-my-working-holiday/living-and-working-with-depression-eee1f9e18a8d): A popular blog I wrote about depression in the workplace. A lot of people contacted me saying that it had given them really useful tips for supporting direct reports or helped them to open up a dialogue with their own manager. Some people said it made them cry -- you've been warned!

## You got any awards 💅

Only one that's relevant to GitHub (but let me know if you're interested in examples of excellent community co-production). I told you I'm into diversity!
